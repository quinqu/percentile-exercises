0.1. Given 1000 measures: How many are above the 90th percentile?  How many are below the 90th percentile?  Above and below the 99.5th percentile?

    - 900 are below, 100 are above
    - 995 are below, 5 are above



0.2 How many measures does a dataset need to have the 99.999th percentile be distinct from the 100th percentile (max) of a dataset?

    - 100,000
0.3 Given a large unknown dataset, what is the probability that one randomly selected measure exceeds the 99th percentile? What is the probability that at least one measure in a sample of 50 that exceeds the 99th percentile of the dataset?

    - .01
    - ~.395

0.4 Given a large unknown dataset, how many measures are needed to have a .5 probability of having 1 or more measures exceed the 99.9th percentile?

    - ~693 (rounded up)
